The folder letters contain the speach sound used as targets
The folder digits contain the speach sound used as primes

Each folder in data contains one file per participant. Each line corresponds to one trial, the columns correspond to the following variables:

- participant initials 
- participant numerical identifier 
- trial number 
- prime congruency ("cong": visual and auditory primes are identical / incong: visual and auditory primes are different) 
- relation between prime and target congruency ("rel" : both primes and targets are identical/different ; "unrel": primes are identical/different & targets are different/identical)
- whether the auditory prime is unmasked (1) or masked (0)  
- whether the visual prime is unmasked (1) or masked (0)  
- auditory prime stimulus (2 / 4 / 6 / 8) 
- auditory target stimulus (b / j / k / m)
- visual prime stimulus (2 / 4 / 6 / 8) 
- visual target stimulus (b / j / k / m)
- response on the target (1: congruent / 0: incongruent) 
- reaction time on the target in milliseconds 
- response on the prime (1: congruent / 0: incongruent) 
- reaction time on the target in milliseconds
